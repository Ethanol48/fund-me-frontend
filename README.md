# fund-me-frontend

This repo is a fork of one project of the repo [foundry-full-course-f23](https://github.com/Cyfrin/html-fund-me-f23)

With some minor changes respecting the style of the website and modifying the code to be compatible with the contract that I deployed


#### contract address (Sepolia): [0x67a361F2F7e4Abd292629E93Bf59D44b4B4a7778](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x67a361f2f7e4abd292629e93bf59d44b4b4a7778)
#### live website: https://fund-me-frontend-ethanol48.vercel.app/

## Prerequisites 

### Deploying the Smart Contract

If you want to deploy this you first need to deploy the contract, head over to [fund-me-backend](https://github.com/Ethanol48/fund-me-backend) 
 

### Changing values

After deploying the FundMe contract you need to change the value of the contract in the file `constants.js`
